# Wine Quality Prediction

This project involves a predictive model that estimates the quality of wine based on various features. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze wine characteristics and predict quality ratings.

 Features:

- pH
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulphur Dioxide
- Total Sulphur Dioxide
- Density
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

 Algorithms Used:

- Support Vector Classifier: Accuracy of 87%
- Random Forest Classifier: Accuracy of 88%


Model Creation:
I have deployed this model locally with the help of flask environment. The result is as follows;
The homepage will input the data from the user and will display the result.
